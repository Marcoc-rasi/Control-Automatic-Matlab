# Control-Matlab

This repository contains various Matlab files that are related to the analysis and control of dynamic systems. Some important points are:

- Here you can see the analysis of physical models, oriented in the control by transfer function, graph and analysis is done in the place of the roots, I also have several codes that helped me with algebraic calculations.
- The function tf is used to create transfer functions from its coefficients.
- The feedback function is used to obtain the closed-loop transfer function from the open-loop transfer function and the controller.
- The rlocus function is used to graph the root locus of a transfer function and see how it changes with the parameter K.
- The step function is used to plot the step response of a system and obtain its characteristics such as rise time, overshoot and settling time.
- The pid function is used to create PID controllers from its Kp, Ki and Kd parameters.
- The sisotool function is used to design controllers by the root locus method or by the frequency method.
- The bode function is used to plot the Bode diagrams of a transfer function and obtain its characteristics such as the phase margin and the gain margin.
- The nyquist function is used to plot the Nyquist diagram of a transfer function and see if it meets the stability criterion.
- The lsim function is used to plot the response to an arbitrary input of a system.
